### Material Table `MatTable`

The material table is taken from EasyDev
and used to render any sort of model component
sent from the backend and each relevant section
for it. 

The Material Table will be implemented using
the fields of the array objects of the same
type. The responsive table will auto-generate
from that and can be used for ranking individuals,
financial items, corruption cases, etc.
